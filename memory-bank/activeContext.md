# Active Context: curate.fun Plugins

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the curate.fun plugins project is on:

1. **Documentation Improvement**: Enhancing the documentation to make it easier for developers to understand and contribute to the project.

2. **Plugin Stability**: Ensuring that existing plugins are stable, well-tested, and handle edge cases appropriately.

3. **Plugin Ecosystem Expansion**: Developing new plugins to support additional transformation types and distribution channels.

4. **Developer Experience**: Improving the development and testing tools to make it easier to create and test new plugins.

## Recent Changes

Based on the repository examination, the project appears to be in active development with the following structure and components:

1. **Core Plugin Types**:
   - Transformer plugins (simple-transform, object-transform, ai-transform)
   - Distributor plugins (rss, telegram, near-social, notion, supabase)

2. **Development Tools**:
   - Example app for plugin management and testing

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Monorepo structure with Turborepo
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Bun for package management and runtime

## Next Steps

The following steps are identified as priorities for the project:

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - Create detailed guides for plugin development
   - Document best practices for plugin implementation
   - Provide examples of common use cases

2. **Plugin Testing Improvements**:
   - Enhance unit and integration testing for existing plugins
   - Develop standardized testing patterns for new plugins

3. **New Plugin Development**:
   - Identify and prioritize new platforms for distribution plugins
   - Explore additional transformation types that would be valuable

4. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Improve the plugin manager interface
   - Simplify the configuration process for plugins

5. **Community Building**:
   - Encourage contributions from the community
   - Establish clear guidelines for plugin contributions
