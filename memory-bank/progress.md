# Progress: curate.fun Plugins

## What Works

Based on the repository examination, the following components appear to be functional:

1. **Core Plugin System**:
   - Plugin interfaces and type definitions
   - Plugin lifecycle management (initialize, operation, shutdown)
   - Plugin registry for discovering and loading plugins

2. **Development Environment**:
   - Example app for plugin management and testing
   - Development server with hot reloading
   - Build system using Turborepo and Rspack

3. **Transformer Plugins**:
   - simple-transform: Basic template-based transformation using Mustache
   - object-transform: Object manipulation and transformation
   - ai-transform: AI-powered content transformation

4. **Distributor Plugins**:
   - rss: Distribution to RSS feeds
   - telegram: Distribution to Telegram channels
   - near-social: Integration with NEAR blockchain social platform
   - notion: Integration with Notion databases and pages
   - supabase: Database operations and storage

5. **Infrastructure**:
   - Monorepo structure with shared configurations
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Bun for package management and runtime

## What's Left to Build

The following areas appear to need further development:

1. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive guides for plugin development
   - Detailed documentation for each plugin
   - Examples and tutorials for common use cases

2. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - More extensive unit and integration tests
   - Automated testing for plugin compatibility
   - Performance testing

3. **Additional Plugins**:
   - More transformer plugins for different content types
   - Additional distributor plugins for other platforms
   - Specialized plugins for specific use cases

4. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Enhanced plugin manager interface
   - Better error reporting and handling
   - Simplified configuration process

5. **Community Tools**:
   - Contribution guidelines and templates
   - Plugin discovery and sharing mechanisms
   - Community forum or discussion platform

## Current Status

The project appears to be in active development with a functional core system and several working plugins. The basic infrastructure is in place, and the focus seems to be on expanding the plugin ecosystem and improving the developer experience.

### Development Status by Component

1. **Core System**: Stable and functional
   - Plugin interfaces are well-defined
   - Lifecycle management is implemented
   - Type system is in place

2. **Development Tools**: Functional but could be enhanced
   - Example app provides basic functionality
   - Build system is working
   - Testing tools could be improved

3. **Transformer Plugins**: Several functional implementations
   - Basic transformation capabilities are available
   - More specialized transformers could be added

4. **Distributor Plugins**: Several functional implementations
   - Distribution to various platforms is supported
   - More platforms could be added

5. **Documentation**: Needs improvement
   - Basic README and contribution guide exist
   - More detailed documentation is needed

## Known Issues

Based on the repository examination, the following issues or limitations may exist:

1. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - Limited documentation for plugin development
   - Incomplete documentation for some plugins
   - Few examples or tutorials

2. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Some plugins may have limited test coverage
   - Integration testing between plugins may be incomplete

3. **Configuration Complexity**:
   - Some plugins may have complex configuration requirements
   - Limited validation or feedback for configuration errors

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Error handling may not be consistent across all plugins
   - Error messages may not be user-friendly

5. **Service Dependencies**:
   - Some plugins require external services to be running
   - Limited guidance on setting up these services

6. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Performance optimization may not be a priority yet
   - Resource usage for complex operations may be high
