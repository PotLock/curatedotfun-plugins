# Project Brief: curate.fun Plugins

## Project Overview

The curate.fun plugins repository is a monorepo that contains a collection of plugins compatible with the curate.fun runtime. These plugins are designed to transform and distribute content in various ways, providing a flexible and extensible system for content curation and distribution.

## Core Requirements

1. **Plugin System**: Maintain a flexible plugin architecture that supports two primary types of plugins:
   - **Transformer Plugins**: Convert content from one format to another
   - **Distributor Plugins**: Send content to external platforms or services

2. **Development Environment**: Provide tools and infrastructure for plugin development, testing, and management, including:
   - Hot reloading for development
   - Plugin registry management
   - Testing utilities

3. **Standardized Interfaces**: Ensure all plugins adhere to consistent interfaces and patterns for:
   - Initialization and configuration
   - Error handling
   - Lifecycle management

4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for:
   - Plugin development
   - Usage instructions
   - Configuration options

## Project Goals

1. **Extensibility**: Make it easy to create new plugins that integrate with various services and platforms
2. **Reliability**: Ensure plugins operate consistently and handle errors gracefully
3. **Developer Experience**: Provide a smooth development experience with clear patterns and helpful tools
4. **Interoperability**: Enable plugins to work together in pipelines or workflows

## Technical Constraints

1. Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
2. Follow a monorepo structure using Turborepo for efficient builds and dependency management
3. Use Bun as the package manager and runtime
4. Maintain backward compatibility for existing plugins when making changes to core interfaces

## Success Criteria

1. Developers can easily create, test, and publish new plugins
2. Plugins reliably transform and distribute content as expected
3. The system is well-documented and follows consistent patterns
4. The plugin ecosystem grows with contributions from the community
